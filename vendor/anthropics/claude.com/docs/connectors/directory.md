# Connectors directory

> Browse verified MCP integrations for Claude

The Connectors Directory is a catalog of verified and reviewed [MCP](/connectors/building/mcp) servers that work across all Claude products — Claude.ai, Claude Desktop, Claude Mobile, Claude Code, and Cowork.

Every integration in the directory is vetted by Anthropic for security, reliability, and compatibility before being made available to users.

<Note>
  All connectors in the directory are subject to the [Anthropic Software Directory Policy](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13145358-anthropic-software-directory-policy) and the [Anthropic Software Directory Terms](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13145338-anthropic-software-directory-terms).
</Note>

## How the directory works

* The same catalog serves Claude.ai, Cowork, Desktop, mobile, and Claude Code.
* Directory connectors are eligible for **Suggested Connectors**—in-chat recommendations when relevant to the user's task. Every directory entry is included automatically.
* Ranking is usage-based, similar to other app stores.
* No domain-ownership proof (DNS or `.well-known`) is required—that requirement applies only to the open MCP Registry, not the Anthropic Directory.
* The help-docs link shown in the in-product connector setup flow is not partner-customizable.

Directory connectors and custom connectors run on the same infrastructure—see [directory vs custom](/connectors/building/directory-vs-custom).

## Browsing the directory

Access the Connectors Directory through:

* **[Settings > Connectors](https://claude.ai/settings/connectors)** in Claude.ai
* **[Admin Settings > Connectors](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/connectors)** for Team/Enterprise admins

## When a connector's endpoint changes

Occasionally a provider updates the endpoint URL behind its directory listing, for example moving a server from `https://mcp.example.com/sse` to `https://mcp.example.com/mcp`. This is a routine change on the provider's side. Here is what you may notice in Claude:

* **Your existing connection keeps working.** Connectors you added before the change keep using the endpoint they were installed with, and your authentication is unaffected.
* **It appears as a custom connector.** Because your connector no longer matches the updated directory listing, it shows under "Custom" in [Settings > Connectors](https://claude.ai/settings/connectors) instead of as a named directory connector.
* **The directory listing shows as not installed.** Adding the connector from the directory again without removing the original gives you two connections: your original one and a new one on the updated endpoint.

To move to the new endpoint, remove the connector and re-add it from the directory. Claude prompts you to authenticate with the service again.

## Submitting to the directory

Organizations can submit their MCP servers for review and inclusion in the directory:

1. Review the [submission guidelines](/connectors/building/submission)
2. Ensure your server meets security and compatibility standards
3. Submit through the [submission portal](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/directory/submissions/new) in Claude.ai admin settings

Submitting requires a Team or Enterprise organization and directory management access (organization Owners by default); see [Before you start](/connectors/building/submission#before-you-start). After publication, the same dashboard shows your server's health and usage; see [Managing your listing](/connectors/building/managing-your-listing).
