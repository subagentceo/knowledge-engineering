**DataChannels subscriber acknowledgment gate (waitForAck)**

DataChannels now support an opt-in subscriber acknowledgment gate. When a subscriber pulls a remote DataChannel with `waitForAck: true`, the SFU holds delivery to that subscriber until it sends its first message (the acknowledgment). This avoids losing the first messages before the subscriber is ready to handle them.

* Opt-in per subscriber; defaults to `false`, so existing behavior is unchanged.
* The acknowledgment is consumed by the SFU and is not forwarded, so the channel stays unidirectional.
* Send the acknowledgment within 15 seconds of creating the remote DataChannel.
* Docs: [DataChannels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/sfu/datachannels/), [Limits, timeouts and quotas](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/sfu/limits/)
