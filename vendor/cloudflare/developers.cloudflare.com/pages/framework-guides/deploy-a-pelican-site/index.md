# Pelican

[Pelican ↗](https://docs.getpelican.com) is a static site generator, written in Python. With Pelican, you can write your content directly with your editor of choice in reStructuredText or Markdown formats.

## Create a Pelican project

To begin, create a Pelican project directory. `cd` into your new directory and run:

Terminal window

```

python3 -m pip install pelican


```

Then run:

Terminal window

```

pip freeze > requirements.txt


```

Create a directory in your project named `content`:

Terminal window

```

mkdir content


```

This is the directory name that you will set in the build command.

## Before you continue

All of the framework guides assume you already have a fundamental understanding of [Git ↗](https://git-scm.com/). If you are new to Git, refer to this [summarized Git handbook ↗](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) on how to set up Git on your local machine.

If you clone with SSH, you must [generate SSH keys ↗](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) on each computer you use to push or pull from GitHub.

Refer to the [GitHub documentation ↗](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) and [Git documentation ↗](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for more information.

## Create a GitHub repository

Create a new GitHub repository by visiting [repo.new ↗](https://repo.new). After creating a new repository, go to your newly created project directory to prepare and push your local application to GitHub by running the following commands in your terminal:

Terminal window

```

git init

git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-gh-username>/<repository-name>

git add .

git commit -m "Initial commit"

git branch -M main

git push -u origin main


```

## Deploy with Cloudflare Pages

To deploy your site to Pages:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.  
[ Go to **Workers & Pages** ](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)
2. Select **Create application**.
3. Select the **Pages** tab.
4. Select **Import an existing Git repository**.
5. Select the new GitHub repository that you created and then select **Begin setup**.
6. In the **Set up builds and deployments** section, provide the following information:

| Configuration option | Value           |  | Production branch | main |
| -------------------- | --------------- |  | ----------------- | ---- |
| Build command        | pelican content |  |                   |      |
| Build directory      | output          |  |                   |      |

1. Select **Environment variables (advanced)** and set the `PYTHON_VERSION` variable with the value of `3.7`.

For the complete guide to deploying your first site to Cloudflare Pages, refer to the [Get started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/).

After deploying your site, you will receive a unique subdomain for your project on `*.pages.dev`.

Every time you commit new code to your Pelican site, Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild your project and deploy it. You will also get access to [preview deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/) on new pull requests and be able to preview how changes look to your site before deploying them to production.
