# Managed Lists

Cloudflare provides Managed Lists you can use in rule expressions. These lists are regularly updated.

Note

This feature requires an Enterprise plan.

## Managed IP Lists

Use Managed IP Lists to access Cloudflare's IP threat intelligence.

Cloudflare provides the following Managed IP Lists:
