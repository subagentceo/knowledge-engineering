# Qwik

In this guide, you will create a new [Qwik ↗](https://qwik.dev/) application and deploy to Cloudflare Workers (with the new [Workers Assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/)).

## 1\. Set up a new project

Use the [create-cloudflare ↗](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) CLI (C3) to set up a new project. C3 will create a new project directory, initiate Qwik's official setup tool, and provide the option to deploy instantly.

To use `create-cloudflare` to create a new Qwik project with Workers Assets, run the following command:

 npm  yarn  pnpm 

```
npm create cloudflare@latest -- my-qwik-app --framework=qwik
```

```
yarn create cloudflare my-qwik-app --framework=qwik
```

```
pnpm create cloudflare@latest my-qwik-app --framework=qwik
```

After setting up your project, change your directory by running the following command:

Terminal window

```

cd my-qwik-app


```

## 2\. Develop locally

After you have created your project, run the following command in the project directory to start a local server. This will allow you to preview your project locally during development.

 npm  yarn  pnpm 

```
npm run dev
```

```
yarn run dev
```

```
pnpm run dev
```

## 3\. Deploy your Project

Your project can be deployed to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or a [Custom Domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/), from your own machine or from any CI/CD system, including [Cloudflare's own](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/).

The following command will build and deploy your project. If you're using CI, ensure you update your ["deploy command"](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/#build-settings) configuration appropriately.

 npm  yarn  pnpm 

```
npm run deploy
```

```
yarn run deploy
```

```
pnpm run deploy
```

## Bindings

Your Qwik application can be fully integrated with the Cloudflare Developer Platform, in both local development and in production, by using product bindings. The [Qwik documentation ↗](https://qwik.dev/docs/deployments/cloudflare-pages/#context) provides information about configuring bindings and how you can access them in your Qwik endpoint methods.

With bindings, your application can be fully integrated with the Cloudflare Developer Platform, giving you access to compute, storage, AI and more.

[ Bindings ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) Access to compute, storage, AI and more.
