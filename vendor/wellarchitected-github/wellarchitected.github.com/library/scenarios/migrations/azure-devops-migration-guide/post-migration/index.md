## Progress tracker

Use this checklist to help guide your post-migration activities:

## Learning resource

Before you begin, review these post-migration resources to support your work:

*   **GitHub documentation**
    *   About GitHub Enterprise Cloud
    *   Governance and policy recommendations
*   **Well-Architected Framework**
    *   Governance Checklist
    *   Security Best Practices

## Repository governance

*    Configure repository rulesets for governance at scale:
    
    *   Deploy enterprise or organization-level rulesets:
        *   Ruleset patterns for critical branches (main, develop)
        *   Tag protection rules to prevent unauthorized tag deletion
        *   Push protection rules for code quality and security
        *   Required status checks and mandatory workflows
        *   Metadata restrictions (commit message formats, signed commits)
    *   Implement security best practices:
        *   Pull request requirements (minimum reviewers, dismiss stale reviews)
        *   Signed commit enforcement using ruleset metadata restrictions
        *   Force push restrictions and linear history requirements
        *   Code owner reviews for sensitive file paths
        *   Restrict bypass permissions to specific roles
*    Establish standardized repository settings:
    
    *   Create repository templates for new projects
    *   Define consistent README structure
    *   Configure default community health files:
        *   CONTRIBUTING guidelines
        *   Issue templates
        *   Pull request templates
        *   Security policy
        *   Code of conduct
*    Apply repository custom properties:
    
    *   Business criticality levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
    *   Compliance frameworks (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
    *   Data sensitivity classification (Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted)
    *   Environment status (Production, Staging, Development, Testing)
    *   Owner team assignment and contact information
    *   Security risk assessment levels

## Integration verification

If you’ve maintained integrations with Azure DevOps services:

### Azure Boards and Pipelines

*    Verify Azure Boards integration:
    *   Repository connections
    *   Work item references and status updates
    *   Bi-directional notifications
    *   User mapping
*    Validate Azure Pipelines functionality:
    *   Service connection status
    *   Build triggers and repository webhooks
    *   Build execution and artifact publishing
    *   Deployment flows

## Team enablement

### Documentation and training

*    Update team documentation:
    *   GitHub flow and branch strategies documentation
    *   Pull request and code review processes
    *   Repository structure and naming conventions
    *   Issue and project management workflows
    *   Security policies and compliance procedures
    *   GitHub Actions workflow documentation
    *   Support escalation paths and contact information
*    Provide ongoing training:
    *   GitHub Enterprise Cloud feature training
    *   Advanced Git workflows and best practices
    *   GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline development
    *   Repository management and governance
    *   GitHub API and integrations for automation
*    Create knowledge bases for:
    *   Common issues and solutions
    *   Best practices for repositories
    *   Workflow optimization techniques
    *   Integration configuration guides
    *   Security implementation guidance

### Support structure

*    Establish internal support mechanisms:
    *   Internal help resources
    *   Escalation procedures with defined SLAs
    *   GitHub Enterprise Support access and contact procedures
    *   Regular office hours and training sessions
    *   Community of practice forums and discussions
    *   Troubleshooting runbooks and common issue resolution guides
*    Implement feedback systems:
    *   Collection mechanisms
    *   Regular review cycles
    *   Process improvement tracking
    *   Feature request management
    *   User satisfaction measurements

## Source system retirement

*    Execute Azure DevOps deprecation plan:
    
    *   Set repositories to read-only
    *   Archive essential data and audit logs
    *   Document system configurations
    *   Remove unnecessary integrations
    *   Clean up service accounts
    *   Plan final decommissioning
*    Preserve critical information:

    *   Change justifications
    *   Exception tracking
    *   Audit preparation
    *   Compliance reporting

### Success metrics and reporting

*    Define and track key metrics:
    *   Repository health metrics (commit frequency, PR merge time, active contributors)
    *   Code review metrics (review coverage, time to review, quality metrics)
    *   GitHub Actions performance (workflow success rates, build times, runner utilization)
    *   Developer productivity metrics (time to merge, code churn, deployment frequency)
    *   Cost optimization metrics (Actions minutes usage, storage consumption, licensing utilization)
    *   Audit log analysis and compliance reporting
*    Establish reporting cadence:
    *   Weekly health checks
    *   Monthly performance reviews
    *   Quarterly governance assessments
    *   Annual strategy alignment
    *   Ad-hoc security audits

## Next steps

1.  Schedule regular governance reviews
