## Learning resources

Before you begin, review these migration-specific resources to support your work:

*   **GitHub documentation**
    *   Migrating repositories with GitHub Enterprise Importer
    *   Reclaiming mannequins
    *   Troubleshooting your migration

## Pre-migration checklist

### Final verification

*    Verify target environment readiness:
    
    Component
    
    Purpose
    
    Status
    
    Authentication
    
    Immediate user access
    
    Teams and permissions
    
    Prevent access issues
    
    Repository policies
    
    Security compliance
    
    Integration settings
    
    Service continuity
    
    Repository rulesets
    
    Code integrity
    
    Audit logging
    
    Compliance tracking
    
*    Perform environment validation tests:
    
    *   Confirm user access and permissions using test accounts
    *   Verify security controls using security simulations
    *   Test integrations with sample data flows
    *   Run sample workflows to confirm CI/CD readiness
    *   Validate repository template functionality
    *   Confirm audit logging configuration

### Communication plan

*    Share detailed migration timeline with all stakeholders. Example:
    
    gantt
      title Migration schedule
      dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
      section Preparation
      Announce migration    :a1, 2025-04-15, 1d
      Team assignments     :a2, after a1, 3d
      Freeze period       :a3, after a2, 1d
      section Migration
      Execute migration   :a4, after a3, 2d
      Validation         :a5, after a4, 1d
      Identity mapping   :a6, after a5, 2d
      section Transition
      Training           :a7, after a4, 3d
      Support period     :a8, after a5, 5d
    
*    Communicate critical information:
    
    *   Expected timing for each repository migration
    *   Expected downtime for each system
    *   Emergency contacts for migration issues
    *   Rollback procedures and triggers
    *   Support channels during and after migration
    *   Training resources for new workflows
    *   Documentation on new processes
*    Establish communication cadence:
    
    *   Pre-migration briefing (1 day before)
    *   Migration day status updates (every 2 hours)
    *   Post-migration summary (end of day)
    *   Issue resolution updates (as needed)
    *   Success confirmation (after validation)

## Migration execution

### Source environment preparation

*    Enable read-only mode for affected repositories:
    
    *   Configure Azure DevOps repositories as read-only
    *   Disable build triggers in Azure Pipelines
    *   Pause integration services and webhooks
    *   Document current active branches for verification
*    Take final backup of repositories for rollback if needed:
    
    *   Clone repositories with all branches and tags
    *   Archive Azure DevOps project configurations
    *   Export pipeline definitions and variable groups
    *   Capture current access control settings
    *   Document active work items and their states
*    Record key Azure DevOps settings:
    
    *   Branch policies and protection rules
    *   Security settings and access controls
    *   Build definitions and triggers
    *   Release pipelines and environments
    *   Service connections and credentials
    *   Work item process templates

### Repository migration

Execute the migration using GitHub Enterprise Importer. For complete instructions, see Migrating repositories from Azure DevOps to GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

```bash
# Basic migration command (all parameters are required)
gh ado2gh migrate-repo --ado-org your-org --ado-team-project your-project --ado-repo your-repo --github-org your-github-org --github-repo your-repo

# Common options
# --target-repo-visibility private     # Set visibility: public, private, or internal (defaults to private)
# --queue-only                         # Only queue the migration, don't wait for completion
# --verbose                            # Show detailed output
```

ℹ️

By default, `gh ado2gh migrate-repo` will run the migration and wait for completion. For large repositories, this may take several hours. Use `--queue-only` to queue the migration and check status separately with `gh ado2gh wait-for-migration`.

*    Monitor migration progress and review logs:
    
    *   Check the “Migration Log” issue automatically created in each migrated repository
    *   Download migration logs for offline analysis using `gh ado2gh download-logs --github-target-org your-org --target-repo your-repo --migration-log-file migration.log` (see Accessing your migration logs)
    *   Review migration warnings for data that didn’t migrate as expected
    *   Track completion times for performance benchmarking
    *   Keep stakeholders informed of progress
    *   Capture performance metrics for future planning
*    Handle migration errors:
    
    *   Review error logs to identify patterns
    *   Address issues based on troubleshooting guide
    *   Use `gh ado2gh abort-migration` to cancel problematic migrations if needed
    *   Retry failed migrations after corrective action
    *   Document workarounds for persistent issues
    *   Escalate critical blockers to support channels
    *   Update runbooks with solutions to common problems

### Verification

Verify the data and state of migrated repositories:

*    Repository content:
    
    *   All branches present (compare branch count)
    *   Commit history complete (validate commit counts)
    *   Tags present (check tag presence)
    *   Code security maintained (validate access controls)
*    Metadata:
    
    *   Pull requests (check status, comments, and work item links)
    *   Comments and reviews (check completeness)
    *   Labels and milestones (verify definitions)
    *   User attribution (review mannequins for reclamation)
*    Repository settings:
    
    *   Visibility (private/public/internal)
    *   Access controls and permissions
    *   Security scanning settings _(requires GitHub Code Security for private repositories)_
    *   Webhooks configured correctly
    *   Default branch name and merge settings
*    Test core workflows:
    
    *   Repository cloning and fetching
    *   Branch creation and pushing
    *   Pull request creation and merging
    *   GitHub Actions workflow execution
    *   Issue creation and management
    *   Code search functionality
*    Test critical integrations:
    
    *   Azure DevOps connections
    *   Authentication systems
    *   Required third-party tools
    *   Essential webhooks
    *   Core automation

### Mannequin reclamation

After successful migration, you’ll need to map migrated users (represented by mannequins) to their GitHub identities:

*    Review mannequin accounts in the migrated repository:
    
    *   Check the “Migration Log” issue in the migrated repository for mannequin information
    *   Generate a CSV file of mannequins using `gh ado2gh generate-mannequin-csv`
    *   Review mannequins directly in the GitHub UI under repository settings
*    Reclaim mannequins:
    
    **Important prerequisites:**
    
    *   Users must be granted access to the organization before mannequins can be reclaimed
    *   For Enterprise Managed Users, use `--skip-invitation` flag
    *   For standard organizations, users will receive an email invitation to accept
    
    ```bash
    # Create a CSV mapping file with this format:
    # mannequin-user-login,target-user-login
    # mannequin_1,actual_username_1
    # mannequin_2,actual_username_2
    
    # For Enterprise Managed Users:
    gh ado2gh reclaim-mannequin --github-org your-org --github-repo your-repo --csv mapping.csv --skip-invitation
    
    # For standard organizations:
    gh ado2gh reclaim-mannequin --github-org your-org --github-repo your-repo --csv mapping.csv
    ```
    
*    Validate mannequin reclamation:
    
    *   Verify attribution appears correctly in the UI
    *   Check pull request authorship
    *   Review remaining unclaimed mannequins
