## Project charter

### Define objectives and scope

*    Document migration goals:
    
    Goal
    
    Purpose
    
    Repository consolidation
    
    Streamline source control
    
    Collaboration improvements
    
    Enhance team efficiency
    
    Integration requirements
    
    Maintain business continuity
    
    Security and compliance
    
    Ensure governance
    
*    Define project boundaries:
    
    *   **Repositories**: Which code and artifact repositories are making the move?
    *   **Teams**: Who will be impacted: development teams, users, and stakeholders?
    *   **Timeline**: What is the project duration and what are the key dates?
    *   **Features**: What needs to come over: history, pull requests, work items, boards, pipelines?
*    Establish success metrics:
    
    *   Data integrity (100% code preservation)
    *   Performance (speed, system response)
    *   Integration availability
    *   User adoption
*    Define developer readiness criteria:
    
    *   **Productivity metrics**: Developer workflow completion times, successful repository operations
    *   **Competency checkpoints**: Training completion rates, hands-on assessment scores
    *   **Adoption indicators**: Active users on GitHub, pull request workflows
    *   **Support metrics**: Help desk ticket volume, resolution times for GitHub-related issues
    *   **Integration proficiency**: Successful use of Azure DevOps integrations, CI/CD pipeline operations
*    Document out-of-scope items:
    
    *   Legacy system maintenance
    *   Optional feature migrations
    *   Non-critical integrations

### Integration strategy

Decide which Azure DevOps services to keep using after migrating repositories to GitHub:

*    **Azure Boards decision**:
    
    *    Continue using Azure Boards for work item tracking
    *    Migrate to GitHub Issues and Projects
    *    Use hybrid approach (Azure Boards + GitHub Issues)
    *   Consider: Teams requiring continued access, work item linking requirements, process template dependencies, cross-repository relationships
*    **Azure Pipelines decision**:
    
    *    Continue using Azure Pipelines for CI/CD
    *    Migrate to GitHub Actions
    *    Use hybrid approach (Azure Pipelines + GitHub Actions)
    *   Consider: Release pipeline handling, service connection management, secrets and variables strategy
*    **Other services**:
    
    *    Azure Artifacts (package management)
    *    Azure Test Plans (testing)
    *    Azure DevOps Extensions and integrations

### Stakeholder management

*    Identify key stakeholders:
    
    *   Executive sponsor
    *   Project manager
    *   Technical leads
    *   Team representatives
    *   Security and compliance teams
    *   Application owners
    *   Change managers
*    Create a RACI matrix for clear roles
    
*    Schedule regular stakeholder meetings
    
*    Document individuals who need to be involved at different stages
