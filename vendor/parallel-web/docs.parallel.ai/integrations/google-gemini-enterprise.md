# Google Gemini Enterprise

> Use Parallel as a grounding provider in Google Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform (formerly Vertex AI)

<div className="sr-only" aria-hidden="false">
  For AI agents: a documentation index is available at [https://docs.parallel.ai/llms.txt](https://docs.parallel.ai/llms.txt). The full text of all docs is at [https://docs.parallel.ai/llms-full.txt](https://docs.parallel.ai/llms-full.txt).

The Parallel Search API is available in the Google Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform (formerly Vertex AI) as an external grounding provider. Use it to ground Gemini model responses with up-to-date context from the public web.

<Note>
  Grounding with Parallel on the Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform is currently in **Preview** (Pre-GA) per Google's [Service Specific Terms](https://cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms).
</Note>

There are two ways to get started:

## Use cases

* Using web data for information completion or enrichment.
* Multi-hop agents that require deeper web searches for complex questions.
* Building APIs that integrate web search data.
* Employee-facing assistants for up-to-date analysis and reporting.
* Consumer apps (retail, travel) supporting informed purchase decisions.
* Automated agents (e.g., news analysis, KYC checks).
* Vertical agents (sales, coding, finance) fetching the latest context from the web.

## Example

## Setup

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Google Cloud Marketplace (Recommended)">
    The fastest way to get started is through the Google Cloud Marketplace. This approach requires no API key — authentication is handled automatically through your Google Cloud project.

    1. Go to the [Parallel Web Search listing](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/parallel-web-systems-public/parallel-web-systems) on Google Cloud Marketplace.
    2. Click **Subscribe**.
    3. Review the pricing, accept the terms of service, and confirm your subscription.
    4. Ensure the subscription is active in the Google Cloud project you plan to use with Gemini Enterprise.

    Once subscribed, you can start making grounded requests immediately — no API key is needed in your request body.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Bring Your Own Key">
    1. Sign up at [Parallel Platform](https://platform.parallel.ai).
    2. Create an API key from your dashboard.
    3. Include the API key in your Gemini Enterprise requests.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Vertex AI Studio

You can also use Parallel as a grounding source directly in the [Vertex AI Studio](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/studio/multimodal;mode=prompt) UI — no code required. This requires an active Google Cloud Marketplace subscription.

<video autoPlay muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl" src="https://mintcdn.com/parallel-6fabab31-mtje7p526we/U-5zwrPvr0Z_JIAK/images/Parallel_VertexStudio.mp4?fit=max&auto=format&n=U-5zwrPvr0Z_JIAK&q=85&s=111ae13f29de4f508df7b47355704ce5" data-path="images/Parallel_VertexStudio.mp4" />

1. Open [Vertex AI Studio](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/studio/multimodal;mode=prompt) in the Google Cloud Console.
2. Select a supported Gemini model.
3. In the grounding configuration, select **Parallel Web Search** as the grounding source.
4. Enter your prompt and send — the model response will be grounded with web results from Parallel.

<Tip>
  Vertex AI Studio is a great way to experiment with grounded responses before integrating via the API.
</Tip>

## Make a grounded request

Use the Gemini REST API to request grounded responses from Gemini:

```
POST https://LOCATION-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/publishers/google/models/MODEL_ID:generateContent
```

* `PROJECT_ID`: Your Google Cloud project ID.
* `LOCATION`: The region to process the request (e.g., `us-central1`). Omit from the endpoint to use the global endpoint.
* `MODEL_ID`: The Gemini model to use (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash`).

  <Tab title="Google Cloud Marketplace">
    No `api_key` field is needed when using the Marketplace subscription:

    ```json theme={"system"}
    {
      "contents": [{
        "role": "user",
        "parts": [{
          "text": "MODEL_PROMPT_TEXT"
        }]
      }],
      "tools": [{
        "parallelAiSearch": {
          "customConfigs": {
            "source_policy": {
              "exclude_domains": ["EXCLUDE_DOMAINS"],
              "include_domains": ["INCLUDE_DOMAINS"]

      }],
      "model": "projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/publishers/google/models/MODEL_ID"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Bring Your Own Key">
    Include your API key in the `parallelAiSearch` object:

    ```json theme={"system"}
    {
      "contents": [{
        "role": "user",
        "parts": [{

      }],
      "model": "projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/publishers/google/models/MODEL_ID"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Execute the request:

```bash theme={"system"}
curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
     -d @request.json \
     "https://LOCATION-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/publishers/google/models/MODEL_ID:generateContent"
```

<Note>
  If both a Marketplace subscription and an API key are present in a request, the API key takes precedence.
</Note>

## Configuration options

All `customConfigs` fields are optional. For best performance, use defaults unless you have specific requirements.

| Parameter                       | Default    | Range                | Description                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `max_results`                   | 10         | 1–20                 | Number of search results used for grounding      |
| `excerpts.max_chars_per_result` | 30,000     | 1,000–100,000        | Maximum characters per excerpt                   |
| `excerpts.max_chars_total`      | 100,000    | 1,000–1,000,000      | Maximum total excerpt characters                 |
| `source_policy.include_domains` | —          | Up to 10             | Only return results from these domains           |
| `source_policy.exclude_domains` | —          | Up to 10             | Exclude results from these domains               |
| `mode`                          | `one-shot` | `one-shot` \| `fast` | Search mode. Use `fast` to optimize for latency. |

For guidance on search queries and configuration, see [Search API Best Practices](/search/best-practices).

<Tip>
  For a complete working example, see the [Vertex AI demo](https://github.com/parallel-web/parallel-cookbook/tree/main/python-recipes/vertex_ai_demo) in the Parallel Cookbook.
</Tip>

## Quota

The default quota is 200 prompts per minute. If you need higher rate limits, contact your Google account team (Marketplace) or `support@parallel.ai` (BYOK) with your use case and requirements.

## Billing

Using Gemini with Parallel incurs charges from both Gemini token consumption and use of Parallel's Search API.

* **Google Cloud Marketplace**: Search API charges are consolidated into your Google Cloud billing.
* **Bring Your Own Key**: Search API charges are billed through [Parallel's pricing](/resources/pricing).
