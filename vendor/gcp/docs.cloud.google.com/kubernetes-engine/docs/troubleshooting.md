Autopilot Standard

This document lists troubleshooting documents for common issues that you might encounter when using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Whether you're diagnosing workload errors like `ImagePullBackOff` and `CrashLoopBackOff`, debugging cluster autoscaling behavior, resolving PersistentVolume issues, or troubleshooting node registration problems, the documents listed here can help.

If you're new to troubleshooting in GKE, start with Introduction to troubleshooting.

To diagnose and resolve issues you encounter, see the documents in the following sections:

*   Cluster setup
*   Autoscaling
*   Storage
*   Cluster security
*   Workloads
*   Cluster management
*   Monitoring
*   4xx errors
*   Known issues

To troubleshoot GKE networking, see Troubleshoot GKE networking in the GKE networking documentation.

This document is for Admins and architects, Security specialists, Networking specialists, or Storage specialists who troubleshoot GKE configurations. To learn more about GKE roles, see Common GKE user roles and tasks.

## Introduction to troubleshooting

Topic

Description

Introduction to GKE troubleshooting

Get started troubleshooting GKE by learning about the overall process and fundamental concepts.

Review service health and incidents

Learn how to check the health of GKE and related Google Cloud services to exclude platform issues.

Assess cluster and workload health in the Google Cloud console

Learn how to use the Google Cloud console to investigate and resolve GKE issues.

Investigate a cluster's state with `kubectl`

Explore common `kubectl` commands and techniques for diagnosing problems in your clusters and workloads.

Conduct historical analysis with Cloud Logging

Understand how to effectively use Cloud Logging to find root causes of issues in GKE.

Perform proactive monitoring with Cloud Monitoring

Utilize Cloud Monitoring dashboards and metrics to identify, diagnose, and resolve GKE issues.

Accelerate diagnosis with Gemini Cloud Assist

Discover how Gemini can assist in diagnosing and resolving GKE problems.

Put it all together: Example troubleshooting scenario

Follow a step-by-step example of troubleshooting a common scenario in GKE.

## Cluster setup

Topic

Description

Cluster creation

Resolve issues with creating clusters.

Autopilot clusters

Diagnose and troubleshoot GKE Autopilot clusters, including cluster creation, namespace deletion, scaling, and workload issues.

Kubectl command-line tool

Troubleshoot the `kubectl` command-line tool in GKE, including issues with authentication, authorization. This page also includes advice on how to troubleshoot the Konnectivity proxy to check if it's causing the `kubectl logs`, `attach`, `exec`, or `port-forward` commands to stop responding.

Standard node pools

Troubleshoot GKE Standard node pools, including issues with node pool creation, best-effort provisioning, corrupted instance metadata, and migrating workloads to new node pools.

Node `NotReady` status

Learn how to diagnose and resolve the node `NotReady` status in GKE by troubleshooting common causes such as resource shortages, network issues, and component failures.

Node registration

Troubleshoot issues that occur when adding nodes to your GKE Standard cluster, such as node registration failures and missing prerequisites for successful node registration.

Container runtime

Troubleshoot container runtimes in GKE, including issues with `containerd` and `dockershim`, and private registries.

## Autoscaling

Topic

Description

Cluster autoscaler not scaling down

Diagnose and resolve common reasons your cluster isn't removing underutilized nodes. Learn how to check for issues like restrictive `PodDisruptionBudgets`, Pods with local storage, or specific annotations (for example, `"cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict": "false"`) that prevent node eviction.

Cluster autoscaler not scaling up

Learn why the cluster autoscaler isn't adding new nodes to meet demand. Check for unschedulable Pods, verify that you haven't hit cluster or node pool size limits, and identify potential resource quota or regional VM availability issues.

Horizontal Pod autoscaling

Troubleshoot problems with the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler not scaling your application's Pod replicas. Resolve common issues, such as misconfigured HorizontalPodAutoscaler objects or problems with the metrics pipeline.

## Storage

Topic

Description

Storage

Troubleshoot storage, including issues with regional persistent disks, disk performance, and volume expansion.

## Cluster security

Topic

Description

Authentication

Troubleshoot authentication in GKE, including issues with RBAC, Workload Identity Federation for GKE, and the GKE metadata server.

Service accounts

Troubleshoot service accounts, including restoring the default service account and enabling the Compute Engine default service account.

Application-layer secrets

Troubleshoot issues that can occur when configuring application-layer secrets encryption, including failed updates and errors where you're unable to use a Cloud KMS key or where the Cloud KMS key version was destroyed.

### Cluster's root Certificate Authority expiring soon

Topic

Description

Root Certificate Authority (CA) expiring

If your cluster's root Certificate Authority (CA) is expiring soon, learn how to perform a credential rotation to prevent normal cluster operations from being interrupted.

## Workloads

Topic

Description

Deployed workloads

Troubleshoot errors for workloads running in a GKE cluster, including `PodUnschedulable`. Read the PodUnschedulable section for advice on errors like `MatchNodeSelector` and `Does not have minimum availability`.

Image pulls

Troubleshoot image pulls. Learn what causes statuses like `ImagePullBackOff` and `ErrImagePull` and how to resolve these statuses by fixing common issues like authentication and network connectivity.

CrashLoopBackOff events

Troubleshoot `CrashLoopBackOff` events in GKE. Diagnose issues like resource exhaustion, app misconfigurations, and liveness probe failures.

OOM events

Troubleshoot Kubernetes Out of Memory (OOM) events. Identify causes, distinguish event types, and apply effective solutions for both container- and node-level OOM kills.

Arm workloads

Troubleshoot issues with Arm workloads, including Pods on Arm nodes crashing.

TPUs

Troubleshoot TPUs, including issues with quota, node auto-provisioning, workload configuration, and scheduling.

GPUs

Troubleshoot GPUs, including issues with GPU driver installation, device plugin errors, and container images.

## Cluster management

Topic

Description

Cluster upgrades

Troubleshoot and resolve GKE cluster and node upgrade issues, including long or incomplete upgrades, unexpected auto-upgrades, failures, and post-upgrade problems.

Webhooks

Understand how to troubleshoot and ensure the stability of your cluster control plane when using admission webhooks.

Namespace stuck in the `Terminating` state

Troubleshoot issues with namespaces stuck in the `Terminating` state by identifying and removing the unhealthy components that are blocking deletion.

Concurrent operations

Troubleshoot concurrent operations by learning how to identify these errors and resolve them by waiting for operations to complete.
