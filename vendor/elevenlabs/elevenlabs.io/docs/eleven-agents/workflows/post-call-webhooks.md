# Post-call webhooks

## Overview

Post-call [Webhooks](/docs/eleven-api/resources/webhooks) allow you to receive detailed information about a call after analysis is complete. When enabled, ElevenLabs will send a POST request to your specified endpoint with comprehensive call data.

ElevenLabs supports three types of post-call webhooks:

* **Transcription webhooks** (`post_call_transcription`): Contains full conversation data including transcripts, analysis results, and metadata
* **Audio webhooks** (`post_call_audio`): Contains minimal data with base64-encoded audio of the full conversation
* **Call initiation failure webhooks** (`call_initiation_failure`): Contains information about failed call initiation attempts including failure reasons and metadata

## Migration Notice: Enhanced Webhook Format

**Important:** Post-call transcription webhooks will be migrated to include additional fields for
enhanced compatibility and consistency, ensure your endpoint can handle the extra fields.

### What's Changing

Post-call transcription webhooks will be updated to match the same format as the [GET Conversation response](/docs/api-reference/conversations/get). The webhook `data` object will include three additional boolean fields:

* `has_audio`: Boolean indicating whether the conversation has any audio available
* `has_user_audio`: Boolean indicating whether user audio is available for the conversation
* `has_response_audio`: Boolean indicating whether agent response audio is available for the conversation

### Migration Requirements

To ensure your webhook handlers continue working after the migration:

1. **Update your webhook parsing logic** to handle these three new boolean fields
2. **Test your webhook endpoints** with the new field structure before August 15th, 2025
3. **Ensure your JSON parsing** can gracefully handle additional fields without breaking

### Benefits After Migration

Once the migration is complete:

* **Unified data model**: Webhook responses will match the GET Conversation API format exactly
* **SDK compatibility**: Webhook handlers can be provided in the SDK and automatically stay up-to-date with the GET response model

## Enabling post-call webhooks

Post-call webhooks can be enabled for all agents in your workspace through the ElevenAgents [settings page](https://elevenlabs.io/app/agents/settings).

![Post-call webhook settings](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://elevenlabs.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/f5edf1792c3791281ade98202614e51d7e93b7b3f6e25db1fdb261d71c13b5ef/assets/images/conversational-ai/postcallwebhooksettings.png)

Post call webhooks must return a 200 status code to be considered successful. Webhooks that
repeatedly fail are auto disabled if there are 10 or more consecutive failures and the last
successful delivery was more than 7 days ago or has never been successfully delivered.

For HIPAA compliance, if a webhook fails we can not retry the webhook.

### Authentication

It is important for the listener to validate all incoming webhooks. Webhooks currently support authentication via HMAC signatures. Set up HMAC authentication by:

* Securely storing the shared secret generated upon creation of the webhook
* Verifying the ElevenLabs-Signature header in your endpoint using the SDK

The JavaScript SDK exposes `constructEvent`; the Python SDK exposes `construct_event` with **`rawBody`**, **`sig_header`**, and **`secret`** (these are not named `payload` / `signature` in Python). Both verify the signature, validate the timestamp, and parse the JSON payload.

Example webhook handler using FastAPI:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs
import os

load_dotenv()

app = FastAPI()
elevenlabs = ElevenLabs(
    api_key=os.getenv("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"),
)

WEBHOOK_SECRET = os.getenv("WEBHOOK_SECRET")

@app.post("/webhook")
async def receive_message(request: Request):
    payload = await request.body()
    signature = request.headers.get("elevenlabs-signature")

    try:
        event = elevenlabs.webhooks.construct_event(
            rawBody=payload.decode("utf-8"),
            sig_header=signature,
            secret=WEBHOOK_SECRET,
        )
    except Exception as e:
        return JSONResponse(content={"error": "Invalid signature"}, status_code=401)

    # construct_event returns a dict (parsed JSON), not an object with attributes
    if event.get("type") == "post_call_transcription":
        print(f"Received transcription: {event.get('data')}")

    return {"status": "received"}
```

Example webhook handler using Express:

```javascript
import { ElevenLabsClient } from '@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

const elevenlabs = new ElevenLabsClient();
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET;

// Use express.text() to preserve raw body for signature verification
app.post('/webhook', express.text({ type: 'application/json' }), async (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['elevenlabs-signature'];
  const payload = req.body; // Raw string body

  let event;
  try {
    event = await elevenlabs.webhooks.constructEvent(payload, signature, WEBHOOK_SECRET);
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid signature' });
  }

  // Process the webhook event
  if (event.type === 'post_call_transcription') {
    console.log('Received transcription:', event.data);
  }

  res.status(200).json({ received: true });
});
```

Example webhook handler using Next.js API route:

```typescript app/api/webhook/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';
import { ElevenLabsClient } from '@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js';

const elevenlabs = new ElevenLabsClient();
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET;

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const body = await req.text();
  const signature = req.headers.get('elevenlabs-signature');

  let event;
  try {
    event = await elevenlabs.webhooks.constructEvent(body, signature, WEBHOOK_SECRET);
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Invalid signature' }, { status: 401 });
  }

  // Process the webhook event
  if (event.type === 'post_call_transcription') {
    console.log('Received transcription:', event.data);
  }

  return NextResponse.json({ received: true }, { status: 200 });
}
```

### IP whitelisting

For additional security, you can whitelist the following static egress IPs from which ElevenLabs requests originate:

| Region       | IP Address     |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| US (Default) | 34.67.146.145  |
| US (Default) | 34.59.11.47    |
| EU           | 35.204.38.71   |
| EU           | 34.147.113.54  |
| Asia         | 35.185.187.110 |
| Asia         | 35.247.157.189 |

If you are using a [data residency region](/docs/overview/administration/data-residency) then the following IPs will be used:

| Region              | IP Address     |
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| EU Residency        | 34.77.234.246  |
| EU Residency        | 34.140.184.144 |
| India Residency     | 34.93.26.174   |
| India Residency     | 34.93.252.69   |
| Singapore Residency | 34.87.23.17    |
| Singapore Residency | 34.126.179.103 |

If your infrastructure requires strict IP-based access controls, adding these IPs to your firewall allowlist will ensure you only receive requests from ElevenLabs' systems.

These static IPs are used across all ElevenLabs services including webhooks and MCP server
requests, and will remain consistent.

Using IP whitelisting in combination with HMAC signature validation provides multiple layers of
security.

## Webhook response structure

ElevenLabs sends three distinct types of post-call webhooks, each with different data structures:

### Transcription webhooks (`post_call_transcription`)

Contains comprehensive conversation data including full transcripts, analysis results, and metadata.

#### Top-level fields

| Field             | Type   | Description                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`            | string | Type of event (always `post_call_transcription`)                       |
| `data`            | object | Conversation data using the `ConversationHistoryCommonModel` structure |
| `event_timestamp` | number | When this event occurred in unix time UTC                              |

#### Data object structure

The `data` object contains:

| ------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent_id`                            | string | The ID of the agent that handled the call                              |
| `agent_name`                          | string | The name of the agent at the time of the conversation                  |
| `conversation_id`                     | string | Unique identifier for the conversation                                 |
| `status`                              | string | Status of the conversation (e.g., "done")                              |

| `version_id`                          | string | The ID of the agent version (snapshot) that was active during the call |
| `environment`                         | string | The environment used for resolving environment variables               |
| `transcript`                          | array  | Complete conversation transcript with turns                            |
| `metadata`                            | object | Call timing, costs, and phone details                                  |
| `analysis`                            | object | Evaluation results and conversation summary                            |
| `conversation_initiation_client_data` | object | Configuration overrides and dynamic variables                          |

As of August 15th, 2025, transcription webhooks will include the `has_audio`, `has_user_audio`,
and `has_response_audio` fields to match the [GET Conversation
response](/docs/api-reference/conversations/get) format exactly. Prior to this date, these fields
are not included in webhook payloads.

### Audio webhooks (`post_call_audio`)

Contains minimal data with the full conversation audio as base64-encoded MP3.

#### Top-level fields

| Field             | Type   | Description                               |
| ----------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `type`            | string | Type of event (always `post_call_audio`)  |
| `data`            | object | Minimal audio data                        |
| `event_timestamp` | number | When this event occurred in unix time UTC |

#### Data object structure

The `data` object contains only:

| Field             | Type   | Description                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `agent_id`        | string | The ID of the agent that handled the call                                      |
| `conversation_id` | string | Unique identifier for the conversation                                         |
| `full_audio`      | string | Base64-encoded string containing the complete conversation audio in MP3 format |

Audio webhooks contain only the three fields listed above. They do NOT include transcript data,
metadata, analysis results, or any other conversation details.

### Call initiation failure webhooks (`call_initiation_failure`)

Contains information about telephony call initiation attempts, including failure reasons and telephony-provider metadata.

Call initiation failure webhook events are sent when a call fails to initiate due to connection
errors, user declining the call, or user not picking up. If a call goes to voicemail or is picked
up by an automated service, no call initiation failure webhook is sent as the call was
successfully initiated.

#### Top-level fields

| Field             | Type   | Description                                      |

| `type`            | string | Type of event (always `call_initiation_failure`) |
| `data`            | object | Call initiation failure data                     |
| `event_timestamp` | number | When this event occurred in unix time UTC        |

#### Data object structure

The `data` object contains:

| Field             | Type   | Description                                              |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent_id`        | string | The ID of the agent that was assigned to handle the call |
| `conversation_id` | string | Unique identifier for the conversation                   |
| `failure_reason`  | string | The failure reason ("busy", "no-answer", "unknown")      |
| `metadata`        | object | Additional data provided by the telephony provider.      |

#### Metadata object structure

The `metadata` object structure varies depending on whether the outbound call was made via Twilio or via SIP trunking. The object includes a `type` field that distinguishes between the two, and a `body` field containing provider-specific details.

**SIP metadata** (`type: "sip"`):

| Field  | Type   | Required | Description                           |

## Audio webhook delivery

Audio webhooks are delivered separately from transcription webhooks and contain only the essential fields needed to identify the conversation along with the base64-encoded audio data.

Audio webhooks can be enabled or disabled using the "Send audio data" toggle in your webhook
settings. This setting can be configured at both the workspace level (in ElevenAgents settings)
and at the agent level (in individual agent webhook overrides).

### Streaming delivery

Audio webhooks are delivered as streaming HTTP requests with the `transfer-encoding: chunked` header to handle large audio files efficiently.

### Processing audio webhooks

Since audio webhooks are delivered via chunked transfer encoding, you'll need to handle streaming data properly:

```python

import base64
import json
from aiohttp import web

async def handle_webhook(request):

    # Check if this is a chunked/streaming request
    if request.headers.get("transfer-encoding", "").lower() == "chunked":
        # Read streaming data in chunks
        chunked_body = bytearray()
        while True:
            chunk = await request.content.read(8192)  # 8KB chunks
            if not chunk:
                break
            chunked_body.extend(chunk)

        # Parse the complete payload
        request_body = json.loads(chunked_body.decode("utf-8"))
    else:
        # Handle regular requests
        body_bytes = await request.read()
        request_body = json.loads(body_bytes.decode('utf-8'))

    # Process different webhook types
    if request_body["type"] == "post_call_transcription":
        # Handle transcription webhook with full conversation data
        handle_transcription_webhook(request_body["data"])
    elif request_body["type"] == "post_call_audio":
        # Handle audio webhook with minimal data
        handle_audio_webhook(request_body["data"])
    elif request_body["type"] == "call_initiation_failure":
        # Handle call initiation failure webhook
        handle_call_initiation_failure_webhook(request_body["data"])

    return web.json_response({"status": "ok"})

def handle_audio_webhook(data):
    # Decode base64 audio data
    audio_bytes = base64.b64decode(data["full_audio"])

    # Save or process the audio file
    conversation_id = data["conversation_id"]
    with open(f"conversation_{conversation_id}.mp3", "wb") as f:
        f.write(audio_bytes)

def handle_call_initiation_failure_webhook(data):
    # Handle call initiation failure events
    agent_id = data["agent_id"]
    conversation_id = data["conversation_id"]
    failure_reason = data.get("failure_reason")
    metadata = data.get("metadata", {})

    # Log the failure for monitoring
    print(f"Call failed for agent {agent_id}, conversation {conversation_id}")
    print(f"Failure reason: {failure_reason}")

    # Access provider-specific metadata
    provider_type = metadata.get("type")
    body = metadata.get("body", {})
    if provider_type == "sip":
        print(f"SIP status code: {body.get('sip_status_code')}")
        print(f"Error reason: {body.get('error_reason')}")
    elif provider_type == "twilio":
        print(f"Twilio CallSid: {body.get('CallSid')}")
        print(f"Call status: {body.get('CallStatus')}")

    # Update your system with the failure information
    # e.g., mark lead as "call_failed" in CRM

```

```javascript
import fs from "fs";

app.post("/webhook/elevenlabs", (req, res) => {
  let body = "";

  // Handle chunked/streaming requests
  req.on("data", (chunk) => {
    body += chunk;
  });

  req.on("end", () => {
    try {
      const requestBody = JSON.parse(body);

      // Process different webhook types
      if (requestBody.type === "post_call_transcription") {
        // Handle transcription webhook with full conversation data
        handleTranscriptionWebhook(requestBody.data);
      } else if (requestBody.type === "post_call_audio") {
        // Handle audio webhook with minimal data
        handleAudioWebhook(requestBody.data);
      } else if (requestBody.type === "call_initiation_failure") {
        // Handle call initiation failure webhook
        handleCallFailureWebhook(requestBody.data);
      }

      res.status(200).json({ status: "ok" });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error processing webhook:", error);
      res.status(400).json({ error: "Invalid JSON" });
    }
  });
});

function handleAudioWebhook(data) {
  // Decode base64 audio data
  const audioBytes = Buffer.from(data.full_audio, "base64");

  // Save or process the audio file
  const conversationId = data.conversation_id;
  fs.writeFileSync(`conversation_${conversationId}.mp3`, audioBytes);
}

function handleCallFailureWebhook(data) {
  // Handle call initiation failure events
  const { agent_id, conversation_id, failure_reason, metadata } = data;

  // Log the failure for monitoring
  console.log(`Call failed for agent ${agent_id}, conversation ${conversation_id}`);
  console.log(`Failure reason: ${failure_reason}`);

  // Access provider-specific metadata
  const body = metadata.body || {};
  if (metadata?.type === "sip") {
    console.log(`SIP status code: ${body.sip_status_code}`);
    console.log(`Error reason: ${body.error_reason}`);
  } else if (metadata?.type === "twilio") {
    console.log(`Twilio CallSid: ${body.CallSid}`);
    console.log(`Call status: ${body.CallStatus}`);
  }

  // Update your system with the failure information
  // e.g., mark lead as "call_failed" in CRM
}
```

Audio webhooks can be large files, so ensure your webhook endpoint can handle streaming requests
and has sufficient memory/storage capacity. The audio is delivered in MP3 format.

## Use cases

### Automated call follow-ups

Post-call webhooks enable you to build automated workflows that trigger immediately after a call ends. Here are some practical applications:

#### CRM integration

Update your customer relationship management system with conversation data as soon as a call completes:

```javascript
// Example webhook handler
app.post("/webhook/elevenlabs", async (req, res) => {
  // HMAC validation code

  const { data } = req.body;

  // Extract key information
  const userId = data.metadata.user_id;
  const transcriptSummary = data.analysis.transcript_summary;
  const callSuccessful = data.analysis.call_successful;

  // Update CRM record
  await updateCustomerRecord(userId, {
    lastInteraction: new Date(),
    conversationSummary: transcriptSummary,
    callOutcome: callSuccessful,
    fullTranscript: data.transcript,
  });

  res.status(200).send("Webhook received");
});
```

### Stateful conversations

Maintain conversation context across multiple interactions by storing and retrieving state:

1. When a call starts, pass in your user id as a dynamic variable.
2. When a call ends, set up your webhook endpoint to store conversation data in your database, based on the extracted user id from the dynamic\_variables.
3. When the user calls again, you can retrieve this context and pass it to the new conversation into a \{\{previous\_topics}} dynamic variable.
4. This creates a seamless experience where the agent "remembers" previous interactions

```javascript
// Store conversation state when call ends
app.post("/webhook/elevenlabs", async (req, res) => {
  // HMAC validation code

  const { data } = req.body;
  const userId = data.metadata.user_id;

  // Store conversation state
  await db.userStates.upsert({
    userId,
    lastConversationId: data.conversation_id,
    lastInteractionTimestamp: data.metadata.start_time_unix_secs,
    conversationHistory: data.transcript,
    previousTopics: extractTopics(data.analysis.transcript_summary),
  });

  res.status(200).send("Webhook received");
});

// When initiating a new call, retrieve and use the state
async function initiateCall(userId) {
  // Get user's conversation state
  const userState = await db.userStates.findOne({ userId });

  // Start new conversation with context from previous calls
  return await elevenlabs.startConversation({
    agent_id: "xyz",
    conversation_id: generateNewId(),
    dynamic_variables: {
      user_name: userState.name,
      previous_conversation_id: userState.lastConversationId,
      previous_topics: userState.previousTopics.join(", "),
    },
  });
}
```
