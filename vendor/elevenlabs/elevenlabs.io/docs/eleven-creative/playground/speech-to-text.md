## Overview

With speech to text, you can transcribe spoken audio into text with state of the art accuracy. With automatic language detection, you can transcribe audio in a multitude of languages.

## Creating a transcript

In the ElevenLabs dashboard, navigate to the Speech to Text page and click the "Transcribe files" button. From the modal, you can upload an audio or video file to transcribe.

![Speech to Text upload](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://elevenlabs.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/596c6fceacbe4659b583db3ba6e2ba0c1f55177cf870654ae5ded693f1ffe43b/assets/images/product-guides/speech-to-text/speech-to-text-modal.webp)

* Select the primary language of the audio if you know it. You can leave this set to "Detect", and any languages within the audio will be automatically detected.

* Choose whether you wish to tag audio events like laughter or applause using the "Tag audio events" toggle.

* Keyterm prompting allows you to add up to 1000 words or phrases to bias the model towards transcribing them. This is useful for transcribing specific words or sentences that are not common in the audio, such as product names, names, or other specific terms.

When you're ready, click the "Upload files" button to submit.

Click on the name of the audio file you uploaded in the center pane to view the results. You can click on a word to start a playback of the audio at that point.

Click the "Export" button in the top right to download the results in a variety of formats.

## Transcript Editor

Once you've created a transcript, you can edit it in our Transcript Editor. Learn more about it [in this guide](/docs/eleven-creative/products/transcripts).
