**_Update:_** _Fine-tuning Claude 3 Haiku in Amazon Bedrock is generally available. (November 1, 2024)_

Customers can now fine-tune Claude 3 Haiku—our fastest and most cost-effective model—in Amazon Bedrock to customize its knowledge and capabilities for their business, making the model more effective for specialized tasks.

## Overview of fine-tuning

Fine-tuning is a popular technique to improve model performance. By creating a customized version of the model, you can train the model to excel at highly tailored workflows.

To fine-tune Claude 3 Haiku, you first prepare a set of high quality prompt-completion pairs—the ideal outputs that you want Claude to provide for a given task. The fine-tuning API, now available in preview, will use your data to create your own custom Claude 3 Haiku. Using the Amazon Bedrock console or API, you can test and refine your custom Claude 3 Haiku model until it meets your performance goals and is ready for deployment.

## Benefits

Fine-tuning allows you to customize Claude 3 Haiku so it can acquire specialized business knowledge, leading to improved accuracy and consistency. Benefits include:

*   **Better results on specialized tasks**: Enhance performance for domain-specific actions such as classification, interactions with custom APIs, or industry-specific data interpretation. Fine-tuning allows Claude 3 Haiku to excel in areas crucial to your business compared to more general models by encoding company and domain knowledge.
*   **Faster speeds at lower cost**: Reduce costs for production deployments where Claude 3 Haiku can be used in place of Sonnet or Opus, while also returning results faster.
*   **Consistent, brand-aligned formatting**: Generate consistently structured outputs tailored to your exact specifications like standardized reports or custom schemas, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and internal protocols.
*   **Easy-to-use API**: Companies of all sizes can innovate efficiently without extensive in-house AI expertise or resources. Anyone can fine-tune models seamlessly, no deep technical expertise required.
*   **Safe and secure**: Proprietary training data remains within customers’ AWS environment. Anthropic’s fine-tuning technique preserves the Claude 3 model family’s low risk of harmful outputs.

We fine-tuned Haiku to moderate online comments on internet forums1, including identifying insults, threats, and explicit content. Fine-tuning improved classification accuracy from 81.5% to 99.6% while reducing tokens per query by 85%.

## Customer spotlight

SK Telecom, one of the largest telecommunications operators in South Korea, trained a custom Claude model to improve support workflows and enable better customer experiences by leveraging their industry-specific expertise.

"Embedding a fine-tuned Claude in our customer support operations has measurably improved our internal processes and overall customer satisfaction. **By customizing Claude, we've seen a 73% increase in positive feedback for our agents' responses and a 37% improvement in key performance indicators for telecommunications-related tasks**. The fine-tuned model now efficiently generates topics, action items, and summaries from customer call logs, and breaks down complex customer issues into manageable steps for better problem-solving," said Eric Davis, Vice President, AI Tech Collaboration Group.

Thomson Reuters, a global content and technology company, has seen positive results with Claude 3 Haiku. The company, which serves professionals in legal, tax, accounting, compliance, government, and media, anticipates even faster and more relevant AI results by fine-tuning Claude with their industry expertise.

“We are excited to fine-tune Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku model in Amazon Bedrock to further enhance our Claude-powered solutions. Thomson Reuters aims to provide accurate, fast, and consistent user experiences. By optimizing Claude around our industry expertise and specific requirements, we anticipate measurable improvements that deliver high-quality results at even faster speeds. **We’ve already seen positive results with Claude 3 Haiku, and fine-tuning will enable us to tailor AI assistance more precisely**,” said Joel Hron, Head of AI and Labs, Thomson Reuters.  

## How to get started
