AGENCY:
Office of Policy Development and Research, Department of Housing and Urban Development,
HUD.
ACTION:
Request for comments.
SUMMARY:
The Department of Housing and Urban Development is seeking comments from the pub-
lic regarding the burden faced when applying for or maintaining eligibility for HUD’s housing
programs. HUD recognizes that these administrative hurdles and paperwork burdens dispro-
portionately fall on the most vulnerable populations and prevent individuals and entities from
accessing benefits for which they are legally eligible. Public comment submitted in response
to this request for comment will assist HUD in better understanding, identifying, and reducing
HUD’s public program administrative burden and ultimately further its mission to pursue trans-
formative housing and community-building policies and programs.

Comment Due Date: August 14, 2023.
ADDRESSES:

on that website to submit comments electronically.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background
Applying for and maintaining eligibility for public benefits and services, including housing pro-
grams, often requires completing and submitting a variety of forms. HUD and its housing part-
ners that administer its programs (including Public Housing Authorities, State and local govern-
ments, non-profit recipients of CDBG programs, Multifamily Housing owners, and FHA lenders)
use the information collected by these forms to determine whether applicants are eligible or if
current recipients continue to be eligible. These forms and other methods of information collec-
tions may create burdens that disproportionately fall on the most vulnerable populations and
prevent individuals and entities from accessing services for which they are legally eligible. These
burdens include the expenditure of time, effort, or financial resources to generate, maintain, or
provide information to HUD or its housing partners. For example, individuals may be required
to provide a list of family members, the family’s total annual family income, the assets available
to each family member in the household, and the value of such assets in order to access public
housing. Individuals applying for or maintaining eligibility for public benefits or services may also
face burdens such as time spent gathering records and documentation needed to prove eligibili-
ty, travel time associated with developing and submitting the collection, or even time waiting to
speak with agency personnel.
Consistent with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), 1 agencies must ensure that both
the quantitative burden estimates and the narrative description supporting its information col-
lection requests reflect the beginning-to-end experience of completing the information collec-
tion activity. Specifically, the burden faced by individuals applying for and maintaining eligibility
for public benefits should also include:
1 Public Law 104–13 (1995) (codified at 44 U.S.C. 3501–3520).
—Information and learning costs, which refer to the time, effort, money, and other resources
that individuals need to expend to learn about the existence of a public service or benefit, rules
governing their eligibility and application, certification, benefits maintenance, and post-award
reporting or recertification processes.
—Compliance costs, which refer to the time, effort, money, and other resources that individu-
als need to expend to follow through with program application, certification, or recertification,
including filling out necessary paperwork, waiting for correspondence from program agencies,
planning for in-person meetings, and producing documentation to confirm their eligibility (for
instance, records of household composition, income, or assets).”””

</Passage>
Please write five factual questions about this document that can be answered with reference
to it and without any outside knowledge. For each question, give three wrong answers and the
right answer. Always put the correct answer first. Write 4 non-numerical questions and one
numerical one. Make sure the wrong answers are highly detailed. Put the question inside <Ques-
tion N></Question N> tags, and the answers inside <Answers N></Answers N> tags, where N is

Guidelines:
Make sure that each question clearly and independently identifies the section/minutes/gov-
ernment meeting from which it derives; avoid terms like “this document”, “this passage”, “this
notice” in favor of more specific descriptions. The goal is to future-proof the questions and
answers in the event that they became divorced from their subject in the filing system.
Make the questions specific to their source text. Eschew generic questions about date of pub-
lication or name of agency. Instead, prefer questions that could not apply to notes produced by
any other department/agency.
