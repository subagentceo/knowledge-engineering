 AWS Directory Service Data is an extension of AWS Directory Service. This API reference provides detailed information about Directory Service Data operations and object types. 

 With Directory Service Data, you can create, read, update, and delete users, groups, and memberships from your AWS Managed Microsoft AD without additional costs and without deploying dedicated management instances. You can also perform built-in object management tasks across directories without direct network connectivity, which simplifies provisioning and access management to achieve fully automated deployments. Directory Service Data supports user and group write operations, such as `CreateUser` and `CreateGroup`, within the organizational unit (OU) of your AWS Managed Microsoft AD. Directory Service Data supports read operations, such as `ListUsers` and `ListGroups`, on all users, groups, and group memberships within your AWS Managed Microsoft AD and across trusted realms. Directory Service Data supports adding and removing group members in your OU and the AWS Delegated Groups OU, so you can grant and deny access to specific roles and permissions. For more information, see [Manage users and groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ms_ad_manage_users_groups.html) in the * AWS Directory Service Administration Guide*. 

**Note**  
 Directory management operations and configuration changes made against the AWS Directory Service API will also reflect in Directory Service Data API with eventual consistency. You can expect a short delay between management changes, such as adding a new directory trust and calling the Directory Service Data API for the newly created trusted realm. 

 Directory Service Data connects to your AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain controllers and performs operations on underlying directory objects. When you create your AWS Managed Microsoft AD, you choose subnets for domain controllers that Directory Service creates on your behalf. If a domain controller is unavailable, Directory Service Data uses an available domain controller. As a result, you might notice eventual consistency while objects replicate from one domain controller to another domain controller. For more information, see [What gets created](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ms_ad_getting_started_what_gets_created.html) in the * AWS Directory Service Administration Guide*. Directory limits vary by AWS Managed Microsoft AD edition: 
+  **Standard edition** – Supports 8 transactions per second (TPS) for read operations and 4 TPS for write operations per directory. There's a concurrency limit of 10 concurrent requests. 
+  **Enterprise edition** – Supports 16 transactions per second (TPS) for read operations and 8 TPS for write operations per directory. There's a concurrency limit of 10 concurrent requests.
+  ** AWS Account** - Supports a total of 100 TPS for Directory Service Data operations across all directories.

 Directory Service Data only supports the AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory type and is only available in the primary AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Managed Microsoft AD](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/directory_microsoft_ad.html) and [Primary vs additional Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/multi-region-global-primary-additional.html) in the * AWS Directory Service Administration Guide*.
