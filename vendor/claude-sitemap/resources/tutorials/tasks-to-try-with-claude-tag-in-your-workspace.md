# Tasks to try with @Claude in your workspace

Tag @Claude in a thread and tell it what you want. It reads what it needs (the messages and files in that channel, plus any tools your team has connected), does the task, and posts the result in the same thread. Claude tags you back, so you stay in the conversation: read what it sent, reply with a change, or hand the thread to a teammate. Tagging is how most tasks start, though once Claude is active in a channel it can also pitch in on its own when it sees a way to help.

Most questions are answered in a few seconds. Bigger tasks, like drafting a doc or fixing a bug, take longer; Claude lets you know it's on it right away, often with a quick reaction, then works in the background and shows you its progress, so you're not sitting and waiting on it.

> New to @Claude? Best practices for working with @Claude covers how tagging works, what Claude can reach, and how to write tasks that come back right.

## What to expect from @Claude

### What you can ask for

Claude replies in whatever form fits the task. You'll see these in the examples below:

*   
    
    **A reply**A message in the thread, the same as any teammate's.
    
*   
    
    **A file or chart**Attached to the thread, with a note on the sources behind it.
    
*   
    
    **An interactive page**A page anyone in your org can open; reply with a change and the same link updates.
    
*   
    
    **Something Claude keeps current**Any of these, updated in place over time so it stays current without anyone asking; good for a digest, an index, or a standing report.
    
*   
    
    **Work done in a connected tool**A pull request opened, a ticket filed, or a record updated, with the result posted back in the thread.
    

### Where you work with Claude

In a channel, you're working in the open: whatever Claude posts, everyone in the channel reads. In your DM, you're working privately: only you see what Claude sends, and there it can also use the tools you've connected to your own account, like your calendar, email, or docs. Learn more about what Claude can access in each place.

### How you steer it

You or anyone on the team can shape how Claude works, just by asking. Put a task on a schedule so it runs on its own, like a recap every Monday morning. On a bigger task, Claude shows you its plan first, so you can adjust the approach up front and redirect it as it works. Tell it to do something differently and it remembers for next time, so it fits your channel better the longer you work with it. And how proactive Claude is, from only replying when tagged to acting on its own, is a per-channel setting your admin controls; ask them to turn it on where you want it.

## What works with no setup

These work the moment Claude is in your workspace, before you connect a single tool. Claude reads and uses what's already in the channel (the messages, the files, the discussion) to complete your task. Start here to see what Claude already understands about your work.



### Keep up with busy channels

Claude reads through a thread or channels and tells you what matters, or finds the specific thing you need and shows where it came from.

Catch up on a thread you missed

Claude reads the thread and lists each decision with who owns it, then what's still open. You get a short list you can act on without rereading the discussion. The reply posts in the thread, so the team sees it too.

Try:@Claude catch me up on this thread: what got decided, who owns each decision, and what's still open?Copy

Keep up with channels you can't follow

In your DM, Claude reads the channels you name and sorts what needs a reply from you from what can wait. You get a short section per channel, with the items that need you at the top. This one's in your DM, so it's just for you.

Try:Catch me up on #gtm-team and #billing-support. What needs me, and what can wait?Copy

Recap the week for your team

Every Monday at the time you set, Claude posts a recap of last week to the whole channel, so the team starts the week knowing what got decided and what's still open.

Try:@Claude every Monday at 9, post what got decided here last week, what's still open, and anything waiting on someone.Copy

Find what never got a reply

Claude reads back through the channel and lists open requests that never got a reply, with who each one is probably waiting on. Each item links to the original message, so you can answer it or tag the right person.

Try:@Claude go through the last two weeks here and list any requests that never got a reply, and who each one is waiting on.Copy



### Turn a discussion into real work

Claude turns the discussion you're having in the channel into something concrete to work from. Take it from there yourself, or keep working on it with Claude in the thread.

Write up a first draft from the thread

Claude reads the thread and writes a first draft from what the team already worked out: the problem, the approach, a mockup, the open questions. The draft opens at a link the team can read; reply with changes and the same link updates.

Try:@Claude write the spec for the feature we've been discussing here. Include a mockup of the main screen and list the open questions at the end.Copy

See the trend in numbers people post

Claude gathers numbers reported in the channel's messages, charts them, and says which messages each point came from. The chart posts in the thread with its source messages, so anyone can check the inputs.

Try:@Claude chart signups by week from the numbers reported here, and say which messages you used.Copy



### Hand off the ongoing work

You set these up once and Claude runs them on its own until you stop it.

Make sure nothing urgent gets missed

You tell Claude which questions it can answer from your docs and what counts as urgent. It reads each message as it arrives, answers the ones it can, tags the owner you named on the urgent ones, and leaves the rest alone. It replies only where you've said it helps.

Try:@Claude watch this channel. Answer questions you can answer from the docs, tag the right owner on anything urgent, and stay quiet otherwise.Copy

Keep a pinned overview of the channel

Claude keeps one message pinned to the channel as its overview: what the channel is for, where things stand at a high level, and links to its key docs. Claude maintains it on its own, updating the pinned message as the channel evolves and noting when it last changed, so anyone landing in the channel can get oriented without asking.

Try:@Claude post and pin an overview of this channel: what it's for, where things stand, and links to the key docs. Keep it up to date as the channel changes.Copy

## Connect the tools you already work in

So far Claude has worked from what's in the channel. When your admin connects a tool to a channel (your codebase, your CRM, your data warehouse, your tracker) Claude can read from that tool and act in it, from the same thread.

With both your channel's past work and your connected tools, Claude does the work with an understanding of your channel, not as a generic assistant. To see what it can reach at any time, just ask: _@Claude what tools can you use in this channel?_



### In an engineering channel

With your codebase connected, Claude reads code, writes fixes, and opens pull requests under its own account, reporting each step back into the thread where the bug came up.

Fix a bug and open a pull request

Claude reads the bug report in the thread, writes the fix, opens a draft PR under its own account, and follows CI and review until it's ready. Each step posts as a reply in the same thread: acknowledged, PR opened, CI passed, ready for your review.

Try:@Claude fix the bug described above and open a draft PR. Watch CI and review comments, and tag me when it's ready to merge.Copy

Map how the system fits together

Claude builds a diagram of your services from the codebase, each box linked to its repo, owner, and channel. The link opens a diagram of what's actually deployed, which helps when the codebase and the architecture doc have drifted apart.

Try:@Claude draw a diagram of how our services connect, with each box showing what it does, who owns it, and its channel.Copy

Build a new hire's first-week page

Claude builds an onboarding page from the codebase and the team's channels: the system map, who owns each service, who to meet first, a tagged first PR. It keeps the page current as ownership changes, so it stays accurate without anyone editing it. Reuse it for the next hire.

Try:@Claude build a week-one page for our new hire: the system map, who owns what, who she should meet and why, and her first PR.Copy



### In a customer or feedback channel

With your CRM and support tools connected, Claude pulls from account notes, support tickets, and feedback channels at once, and shows the messages and accounts behind every claim.

Rank what customers are asking for

Claude reads across your feedback channels, CRM notes, and support tickets and ranks the requests. The link opens a ranked list, each item showing the messages and accounts behind it.

Try:@Claude rank the top product requests from our customer channels and CRM over the last quarter, with the messages and accounts behind each.Copy

Get briefed on an account before a call

In your DM, Claude reads the CRM, the account's channel, and recent threads, and writes the brief: spend, the people you'll talk to, what's open, what changed recently. Each line names where it came from, and if the CRM and the channel disagree, Claude flags it. This one's in your DM, so it stays yours.

Try:@Claude brief me on the Northwind account before my 3pm: spend, who I'll be talking to, what's open, and anything that changed this month.Copy



### In a data or metrics channel

With your warehouse connected, Claude writes the query, runs it, and posts the chart with the SQL right there in the thread.

Get an answer straight from the data

Ask the data question in the thread. Claude writes the query, runs it against your warehouse, and posts the chart with the SQL underneath, so anyone can check it or rerun it.

Try:@Claude chart weekly active users for the last 8 weeks, split by plan. Show me the query.Copy

Build a dashboard for one decision

Claude builds one page with the numbers a specific decision needs, written so anyone in the meeting can read it. The link opens a single page: a few charts, each with one plain-language line under it.

Try:@Claude build one page with the numbers we need for the pricing decision: revenue by plan, churn by plan, and what changes under each option.Copy

See where users drop off

Claude maps a multi-step flow from your warehouse, shows how many people make it through each step, and marks the biggest drop, so the team can focus on the step that's losing the most people. The chart posts in the thread, with the query right there to check or rerun.

Try:@Claude map our signup funnel from the warehouse: how many people reach each step, and where's the biggest drop-off?Copy



### In a docs or policy channel

With your document store connected, Claude reads the current version and answers from it, quoting the section and linking to it.

Answer from the current version of a doc

Claude reads the live document and answers from what it says today, quoting the section and linking to it, so anyone can click through to confirm.

Try:@Claude what does our current refund policy say about annual plans cancelled in month two? Quote the section.Copy

Prepare for a meeting

In your DM, where Claude can also reach your own connected tools, it reads the related channel, the doc in your drive, and your calendar, and writes the brief: the points to push on, each naming its source. This one's in your DM, so the prep stays private.

Try:I have the pricing review at 2. Read #q3-pricing-review and the proposal in my drive, and give me the three points I should push on.Copy



### In your team's working channel

With your ticket or project tracker connected, Claude reads the tracker and the channel discussion together and tells you who's blocked, on what, and for how long.

List who is blocked and on what

Claude lists who's blocked, what they're waiting on, who they're waiting for, and how long. The link opens a short table, each row linked to the ticket and the thread. Useful before standup, or on a schedule so it runs before the week starts.

Try:@Claude who on the team is blocked right now, on what, and for how long? Pull from our tickets and this channel.Copy
