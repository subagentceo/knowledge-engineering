  Carta Web / Fund Admin investors data queries against the data warehouse. For

  sheets, cap tables, ownership %, shareholders, 409a valuations, FMV, MOIC, fund holdings,
  or what a fund is invested in. Covers funds in Carta Web / Fund Admin
  only. Carta Fund Forecasting (formerly Tactyc) is a SEPARATE domain with its own funds — for
  performance metrics of a fund in Fund Forecasting, use carta-fund-forecasting instead. Unless
  the user has said which system the fund is in, ask whether it's in Carta Web / Fund Admin or
  Fund Forecasting (Tactyc) before answering a fund-performance question. Prefer over carta-soi
  for data queries (carta-soi is for Cowork persistent artifacts); over carta-portfolio-valuations
  for read-only valuation/MOIC/investment data (that skill runs/updates valuation
  projects); over carta-lp-dashboard unless asked by name; over carta-consolidating-balance-sheet
  for single-fund balance sheets.

# Explore Data

Query the Carta data warehouse for investors data — NAV, performance metrics, cash flow statements, balance sheets, portfolio financials, and more.

## When to Use

This is the skill for **Carta Web / Fund Admin** data work — the data warehouse. Note that **Carta Fund Forecasting (formerly Tactyc)** is a separate domain with its own funds and data; when a fund question could belong to either system and the user has not said which, **ask them which system the fund is in before answering** (see below) rather than defaulting to this warehouse.

* **Always use** when the user context is set to a `Firm` and the request involves any Carta Web / Fund Admin data query, financial metric, or reporting question
* **Do NOT use** for funds that live in **Carta Fund Forecasting (formerly Tactyc)** — that is a separate domain with its own data; use `carta-fund-forecasting` for performance metrics (TVPI/DPI/IRR/MOIC/NAV/reserves) of those funds. **Unless the user has explicitly said which system the fund is in, ask them** whether the fund is in Carta Web / Fund Admin or in Fund Forecasting (Tactyc) before answering — do not assume this skill's warehouse is the right source
* **Always use** for portfolio queries, holdings questions, fund breakdowns, or "what is [firm/fund] invested in" phrasing — even though those phrases appear in `carta-soi`'s trigger list; `carta-soi` is for building persistent Cowork artifacts, not answering data questions inline
* **Always use** for read-only valuation data (409a history, FMV, MOIC, investment metrics) — even though "valuations" and "portfolio companies" appear in `carta-portfolio-valuations`; that skill is for running and updating valuation projects, not reading data
* Also use when **no context is set** and the user asks an ambiguous investment or data question — this skill will guide them through context setup via `list_contexts` / `set_context`

## Prerequisites

The user must have the Carta MCP server connected. If this is the first query in the session:

1. Call `list_contexts` to see which firms are accessible
2. Call `set_context` with the target `firm_id` if needed
3. For **cap table queries** — confirm the corporation ID before running. If the user names a portfolio company, resolve its `CORPORATION_ID` from `CORPORATION_BASIC_INFO_V2` first (see Step 1 table below)

> **Firm context — tool priority rule:** When the active context is a **Firm**, prefer `fa:*` MCP commands over raw DWH queries. These commands are purpose-built for investor-facing data and return cleaner, pre-aggregated results. Fall back to `dwh:execute:query` only when no `fa:*` command covers the requested data.
>
> **Never call `cap_table:*` or `cap_table_chart` in firm context.** Those MCP commands require a direct cap-table-tenant user role and reject UUID-only corporation IDs — most portcos surfaced by `fa:list:portfolio_companies` are exposed via the investor portal, not as direct tenant members, so these calls will fail. If a DWH query returns no useful result for a cap-table prompt, tell the user the data is not available rather than retrying with `cap_table:*`. See `semantic-layer/cap-table.md` for the full routing rationale and the DWH queries to use instead.

## Step 0 — Fetch portfolio companies (MANDATORY GATE)

> **Prerequisite:** Complete the session setup above (`list_contexts` / `set_context`) before this step. `fa:list:portfolio_companies` requires an active firm context and will return an empty list if none is set.

**After setting context**, always fetch the list of portfolio companies the user has access to:

```
call_tool({"name": "fa__list__portfolio_companies", "arguments": {}})
```

This call is required even if the user named a specific company — it establishes which companies are accessible in the current firm context and provides the `corporation_id` values needed for cap table queries. Do not skip this step.

- If the result is empty, tell the user their firm context may not be set correctly and call `list_contexts` to diagnose.
- If the user asked about a specific company, use the result to resolve the exact `corporation_id` for that company before continuing to Step 2.

## Step 1 — Identify the Query Domain

Use this table to pick the right context file before running any query:

| User is asking about                                                                                                                                                                                       | Context file to read                              | Primary table / tool                                                      |

## Step 2 — Load the Context File

Read the matching file from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/carta-explore-data/semantic-layer/<domain>.md`:

The file contains the SQL query, column reference, and presentation rules for that domain. Follow them exactly.

> **Cap table prerequisite check** — before loading `cap-table.md`, verify:
> 1. The MCP context is set to a **firm** (not a fund or LP). Call `list_contexts` if unsure.
> 2. A `CORPORATION_UUID` is available. If the user named a company, resolve it from `CORPORATION_BASIC_INFO_V2` — match by name, UUID, or integer ID depending on what the user supplied:
>    ```sql
>    -- CORPORATION_BASIC_INFO_V2.CORPORATION_ID is INTEGER. SUMMARY_CAP_TABLE / FUND_CORPORATION_OWNERSHIP
>    -- match on UUID (TEXT). Pass CORPORATION_UUID — never CORPORATION_ID — to cap-table.md queries.
>    SELECT DISTINCT CORPORATION_ID AS corporation_integer_id, CORPORATION_UUID, CORPORATION_NAME
>    FROM FUND_ADMIN.CORPORATION_BASIC_INFO_V2
>    WHERE LOWER(CORPORATION_NAME) LIKE '%<user-supplied name>%'
>       OR CORPORATION_UUID = '<user-supplied uuid>'
>       OR CORPORATION_ID = <user-supplied integer id>
>    LIMIT 10
>    ```
>    If multiple matches are found, use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm which one before continuing.

* IMPORTANT: if a specific semantic layer was not found, check for Saved Questions by running `call_tool({"name": "fa__list__saved_queries", "arguments": {}})` to get a list of existing questions and descriptions saved on the Data Warehouse. Use `call_tool({"name": "fa__get__saved_query", "arguments": {"name": "<query_name>"}})` to retrieve the SQL of a matching saved query, where `<query_name>` is the `name` field returned by `fa__list__saved_queries`.

## Step 3 — Execute the Query

> **Before executing — resolve uncertainty first**
>
> If the semantic domain or target table is not yet clear:
>
> 1. **Unclear intent — ask immediately.** If the user's request is simple, ambiguous,
>    or contains a term that doesn't map to any known domain, table, or Carta concept
>    in the Step 1 table, immediately call `AskUserQuestion` with focused options to
>    resolve the ambiguity. Do **not** respond in prose first — go straight to
>    `AskUserQuestion`.
> 2. **Inspect the schema.** Use `call_tool({"name": "dwh__get__table_schema", ...})` on any plausible
>    table before referencing it in a query.
> 3. **Ask up to 2 clarifying questions.** If, after checking saved queries (Step 2)
>    and schema inspection, you still cannot identify the right table or domain, use
>    `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user **at most 2 focused questions** that will resolve
>    the ambiguity — e.g. fund-level vs company-level, metric type, entity name. After
>    receiving answers, re-run Steps 1–2 before querying.
>
> **Never assume a table name or domain.** Guessing produces incorrect or empty results.

Use the MCP commands in sequence:

1. **Browse tables:** `call_tool({"name": "dwh__list__tables", "arguments": {"schema": "FUND_ADMIN"}})`
2. **Inspect schema:** `call_tool({"name": "dwh__get__table_schema", "arguments": {"table_name": "<TABLE>", "schema": "FUND_ADMIN"}})`
3. **Run the query:** `call_tool({"name": "dwh__execute__query", "arguments": {"sql": "..."}})`

** Schema: ** Use the schema matching the domain identified in Step 1. For most queries use `FUND_ADMIN`. For Loan Ops queries, use `LOAN_OPS` instead of `FUND_ADMIN` in every command above.
**Output format:** Present results as a markdown table. Use fund or company names as row headers — never raw UUIDs. Currency values use `$X,XXX` format with commas; percentages use `X.XX%`. Bold totals and summary rows.

## General Query Rules

- **Always include LIMIT** — default `LIMIT 200`; use 50–500 for aggregations
- **Only SELECT** — no INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or DDL
- **Do not query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`** — it is not supported in this data warehouse; use the semantic layer files and `call_tool({"name": "dwh__list__tables", ...})` / `call_tool({"name": "dwh__get__table_schema", ...})` instead
- **Date fields** — `effective_date` for `JOURNAL_ENTRIES`; `month_end_date` for `MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS`; `investment_date` for `AGGREGATE_INVESTMENTS`
- **Deduplication** — for `MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS` and `AGGREGATE_FUND_METRICS`, use `QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY fund_uuid ORDER BY last_refreshed_at DESC) = 1`
- **ALLOCATIONS has multiple rows per fund** — always `GROUP BY fund_uuid` with `MAX(fund_name)` when using it for fund metadata

## General Presentation Rules

Each semantic file's `## Presentation` section is the source of truth for its domain. When a semantic file does not specify, fall back to these defaults:

- **Render results as a markdown table** with clear column headers
- **Use names, never raw UUIDs** as row identifiers — fund name, company name, LP name
- **Currency** — `$X,XXX` with commas; negatives/outflows in parentheses `($X,XXX)`; bold totals `**$X,XXX**`
- **Percentages** — `X.XX%`
- **Multiples** — `X.XXx` (e.g. MOIC, TVPI, DPI)
- **Missing values** — show `—` rather than `0` or `null` to avoid implying a real zero
- **Use Carta voice** — "your fund's NAV", "your portfolio", not "query results"
